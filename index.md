A course calendar will be available on the Deep Dive Coding Data Science Bootcamp pre-work & general information site before the bootcamp begins. All quizzes, exams, project due dates, and other important bootcamp events are shown in the course calendar. We’ll make multiple announcements (in class, on Slack, or here in the web site) leading up to each due date; however, it is ultimately each student’s responsibility to review the calendar on a regular basis, and to complete their exams and projects on-time.

During the course, some event dates and due dates may need to be modified due to unforeseen conflicts, cancellations, etc. Any such changes will be announced in advance, and reflected in changes to the course calendar.


# Course Description

The Deep Dive Coding Data Science Bootcamp is a 10-week long, intensive, immersive development course, covering a range of topics related to data science: fundamental data science concepts; Python and R programming; common data science tools (Jupyter, Guthub, Cloud), data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning methods, machine learning methods, artificail intelligence, natural language processing, and data visualization as students complete structured exercises, as well as individual and team projects.

Students will become fluent in the data science process and create a project portfolio to present to employers. They will be exposed to professionals in the industry, to learn essential elements of the professionals’ success, and to build their own networks. Professional development, presentation, and image are also covered in preparation for entering the data science job market.

There are two primary sets of deliverables:
- Learning-based projects: Completion of five projects focused on different applications of the data science tools taught in the bootcamp.
- Capstone: Large-scale data science-based analysis of a relevant data set by teams of 3-4. This project will include a thorough application of the data science process using tools taught during the bootcamp. The communication of the results during a presentation through data visualization will be key.


# Instructors and coaches

- Lead instructor: Cliff Lewis
  - E-mail: [clewis47@cnm.edu](mailto:clewis47@cnm.edu)

- Assistant instructor: TBD

- Student Success Manager: Sue Andres
  - Slack: @Sue Andres
  - E-mail: [sandres1@cnm.edu](mailto:sandres1@cnm.edu)

- Employee Relations Manager: Esteban Martinez
  - Slack: @Esteban Martinez
  - E-mail: [emartinez394@cnm.edu](mailto:emartinez394@cnm.edu)

Outside of the classroom, the primary means of contact between bootcamp participants and instructors, coaches, and other bootcamp staff is Slack. It is the participant’s responsibility to contact the instructors for any issue related to the course—e.g. grading, completion of assignments, attendance, conflicts. It is also the participant’s responsibility to check Slack on at least a daily basis (preferably more often), and to inform the instructors of any change in contact information or availability (e.g. email address change, inability to access the course content server, inability to access the Deep Dive Coding Slack workspace).

Given the intensive face-to-face nature of the bootcamp, instructors will generally not conduct office hours outside of normal class hours. Any participant who wishes to meet with instructors outside of class is responsible for requesting such a meeting in advance.


# Evaluation

The class will be evaluated in three categories:

- Capstone: 55%
- Class Projects: 35%
- Assessments: 10%

The class projects occur throughout the bootcamp and will be scored immediately after the due date of the project. The assessments will occurs after the conclusion of each project. The overall passing score in the class is ≥ 75.00%.


# Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, the participant will be able to:

1. Code a data science project in Python. 
1. Code a data science project in the R language. 
1. Download data from the web and API sources. 
1. Use data wrangling techniques to prepare and refine raw data sets. 
1. Access specific data fields in a database using SQL queries.  
1. Use existing data visualization tools to visualize data. 
1. Perform supervised learning and classification. 
1. Perform unsupervised learning and classification. 
1. Perform natural language processing. 
1. Perform artificial intelligence applications. 
1. Perform data science processing tasks in the cloud. 
1. Utilize Github as a code repository and as a code portfolio for employers. 


# Ask good questions

Asking questions is critical in data science. Data scientists are constantly under stress and realize that being a good team player is sharing the burden. Because of this stress, **well researched questions are _vital_**. The strategy you are required to use is:
- Read the documentation, code examples, Google searches, etc for at least 20 minutes.
- Ask your peers.
- Ask your instructors.
This process will engage you in the problem on a deep level and form good habits required in the data science world.


# Attendance and Participation

As stated in the course expectations and policies, attendance is crucial: failure to maintain satisfactory attendance may result in a student's dismissal from the bootcamp. The standard for attendance in this Deep Dive Coding bootcamp is not simply a matter of physical presence, but also includes active participation in classroom lectures and exercises, workouts, professional development activities, and adherence to a minimal set of programming practices, standards, and conventions.

In particular, the expected practices include the diligent use of the git version control system and the GitHub service for maintaining repositories of work done in the bootcamp: As a rule, your work in classroom exercises and projects is assessed according to what has been placed under Git version control and pushed to GitHub. A student's failure to follow this practice for project work will significantly impact the score the student receives for the project(s). A student's repeated failure to follow this practice for work done in classroom exercises may result in the student being dismissed for unsatisfactory attendance and participation.

Unless a student has previously arranged to opt out of one or more workout or professional development activities, failure to participate in these will be treated as an unexcused absence.
